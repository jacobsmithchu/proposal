My walk with pride

I have two lives, the second one began after I met you.

How do I tell what lies in me for you. Everything. Without end, and the start.
Words wonâ€™t carry my ink of heart.
Kaise bayaan krun,ðŸ’Œ Tum mujhme mujhse jyadaa ho.
Love and silence are the two deepest language of our soul.
In the quiet I loved you.

And if you ask me what love is,
I will not speak.
I will sit beside you
â€” and let silence do the talk.
Come Maysa, itâ€™s a garden date. You are an esteem Iâ€™d walk!

Enough for the silence. I have to say a lot. A canvas is short, love, allow me your heart.

Let me wrap my words around you, so you know you'll never be alone.
Give me your loose threads so I can weave them into a poem.

Where there is my love, the whole existence becomes a poem.
You, my flower of life, that blooms under a poem.
Why does my heart hold so much of you?
Can love ever be caused?
Oh my friend! Love is always uncaused.
She is mystery that imparts time to pause.

Oh but what if I told you â€” you are a poem?
A symphony of love, a delicate bloem.
Your words craft feelings, your feelings sculpt mountains.
And within your sight to me,
A part of you becomes timeless.
In the canvas of your creation, you're the muse.
A radiant sunset, delicate hues.
In the ink of existence, we don't just write â€” we live within each word, day and night.
Oh, who embodies a poem's sweet art, more than the poet, with a soulful heart?

Forever yours â€”
in ink, in shadow, in light,
