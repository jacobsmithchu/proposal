My EidolonÃ©,

Hello to Petals of the past,
I saw a few strangers write their names in own confinement. Spray laughs on that one echelon where I met my light of linger, Hey jude, I knew I found the one now. she would write my name in long letters with spray paints on that one wall behind heart, Hey jude, None of it has faded now.

You, my predestined-alibi. How amongst the odd of life, I met you at this very place, at this very time.

The day I first met thee, Maysa. I knew not I was meeting you â€” but rather remembering you, as if my soul had waited lifetimes for thine.

You clicked my soul no one could even see bare of. I refuse to believe the role of fate when two souls ache, trench and craft a Meet. You did, I did.

Months passed, days sailed. I realized. You didnâ€™t arrive like lightning. You arrived like breath â€” and suddenly I couldnâ€™t live without it. We both couldnâ€™t. We finally found each other. Every night belonged to you and every day I would wait for it. Fun, talks, screenshots, shenanigans â€” everything I rejoiced was anything but to you!

I longed to you so much, that every moment without you, my heart be, exilâ€™d from your gentle grace. Love, you are the moment that lasts forever. With you, there is no time â€” only the pulse of now, and the eternity it carries.

One may ask how is it love when it hasnâ€™t been confessed. I ask, does expression need confession? We were always none of the label. Relations need structure, love is unstructured. Relationshipsâ€”closed, finished, deadâ€”a complete thing. My love for you was always flowing, one label to another. A stranger to gasp of your heart.

O! what strange alchemy, what soft despair, To meet one's fate so sudden, unaware. For in that glanceâ€”brief, boundless, unrehearsâ€™dâ€” I knew: I loved her from the very first.

Hey Jude, the course of love never did run smooth, ever did it? Ask your journal, I am an alibi. She is my destiny. Delulu was just our apophany. We grew closer and closer... But hey Jude, even love bleeds beneath its pretty veil.

I went far. Ask her journal, was I the missing frail? Indeed you said. A tender ache â€” when distance comes, not to divide, but to deepen.

I wonder where those two strangers sail? I wonder if they're still friends. I'd like to believe they are, spray painting more boring walls, in huge messy letters, contrast of beige on blue, who can say THAT isn't an art? You know how they say, â€œAny moment might be our last." I repaid my debt but you never asked what you owed me. An owe of debt this wasn't even a first partâ€” You searched strange cities for me. A love such it would search me in every pieces of heart...

Where do we go now? Where do we find what we're looking for? In yet another strange street I walk just to find you around as aimlessly as fragile the concept to "living" is. Unpredictably delirious, but at least dare to be so. To abandon the faded paint, to forget that we're doomed and this moment IS THE LAST. I wish we had painted our grass greener; for all along,

â€œTwo gin-scented tears, trickled down the sides of his nose. But it was all right, everything was all right, the struggle was finished. He had won the victory over himself."
If all it took was burying oneself in the grave they dug for eternal contentment, if betraying one's love was the only drug, if there was no path but to descend to hell for an alternate nirvana to be found, was it worth the parallel of having moulded one's individuality unsound? I refrain, love prevails. He didnâ€™t betray! She was his nirvana. Kosher, real, his own. He reverts to his eternal contentment.

We know too well what to pick if there was a choice. But, there never is. In the face of oppression, there is no voice. â€˜We shall meet in the place, where there is no darkness,â€™ he said, in a cage so confining, so left are no ashes to be, yet an anticipation of this ever-lasting stupidity. He asks her to set him free. She might be his light!

Then, in the late winters she asks me could we be two and two equal twenty two!? Today I have to tell you back. The whole world is lie. Propositions set on fabricate. For me will you craft a new life?

From a jinx to the one which may never jinx what we have. From strangers to mail. A personal advisor for while. My dear let me take out that while. Forever for my eve!
If you ever asked who were the strangers with friendships fallen apart, ruinous without cause. We were the strangers, painting on the walls. // Cause now, you were the cause ðŸŽ´
Cause you were the paint that made me an art! ðŸ¥€
