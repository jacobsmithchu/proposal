        <h1>I have a question</h1>
        <div class="text-content">
          <p>
            I don't know how to begin.<br />
            I have tried a hundred times.<br />
            I've written your name on paper until it bled into my skin,<br />
            and yet nothing I say matches the ache that you are in me.
          </p>

          <p>
            There is a Turkish saying ‚Äî if you love a person, you love them
            twice.<br />
            Once when you say "I love you." And forever seems the end of
            beginning!<br />
            Before I spoke your name,<br />
            My heart was already singing it.<br />
            Before I touched your hand,<br />
            My soul had already held you in silence.
          </p>

          <p>
            O Maysa, Beloved ‚Äî<br />
            You are not just the love of my life.<br />
            You are life within my love.<br />
            In every lifetime, I would find you.<br />
            In every world, I would choose you.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let us not speak of time, or logic, or fate,<br />
            Let us speak only of flame today ‚Äî<br />
            That dance when your love meets the soul of mine.
          </p>

          <p>
            There is no easy way to say this.<br />
            Loving you has not been a choice ‚Äî<br />
            It has been a quiet revolution of my entire being.<br />
            Even in silence, I hear you.<br />
            Even in absence, I am full of you.
          </p>

          <p>
            They say love is momentary. But what a moment!<br />
            One could wait eternity for it. I have.
          </p>

          <p>Love. Thus, I found thee.</p>

          <p>
            Come ‚Äî let us be lovers,<br />
            Not for the moment,<br />
            But of the infinite.
          </p>

          <p>
            Will you be mine ‚Äî<br />
            Not for reason, but for the forever we already are?
          </p>

          <p>
            Love, you are no mortal light ‚Äî<br />
            But a tender storm. An Apocalypse. Our first song.<br />
            Pull the oceans from their quiet graves.<br />
            I, poor heart, was but a room of ash,<br />
            Until you did spark and silent crash. <br />
            Thee ‚Äî<br />
            Each moment now sings, ‚ÄúShe is, and I must be.‚Äù I shall offer you,
            everyday, a love, Maysa ‚Äî<br />
            Mine, raw and forever. But today, I shall ask a question. I am not a
            man of wants. I would ask none of the universe for even a breath.<br />
            Today, for once, I shall! I come to you, my creation. I have a
            question. Today, no words may dwindle. I ask you with my raw heart.<br />

          </p>

            <i>
            Will you be my girlfriend? For every night, the sky filled with the
            stars‚Äîwould you let me see them through the reflection of your eyes?
            Will you be the breath I‚Äôll choose again and again? I ask you, love,
            I may not be perfect but I have found my love perfectly. Will you be
            mine‚Äî Not in fairy tales, But in this strange, flawed, beautiful
            life? Will you be the reason I no longer fear time? For the tough
            times ahead and for joys that will make it up for! Would you tell me
            every little thing that you feel terrible about, and let me love you
            still?</i></p>  
            
            <p>To she whose presence stilled my time, Whose name I carry
            like breath on lips‚Äî This is not merely a proposal. This is my truth,
            veiled in poetry. Will you be mine? As I‚Äôm thine‚Äî In fire, in flesh,
            in every line.</p>
